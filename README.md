# Dotfiles

These are my configs for my Arch Linux setup. I have listed my core utility choices below:
- Window manager: [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)
- Bar: [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- App launcher: [fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel)
- Shell: [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
- Terminal: [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- Editor: [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) using [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)

For additional configuration notes:
- Reader: [zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura)
- Fetch: [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)
- I have not yet learned how to make a good color scheme, so I've deferred that aspect of my system to the popular [Catppuccin-Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palette.
